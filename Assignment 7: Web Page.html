<h1>Carolina Hurricanes</h1>
<body>
<p>Previously the Hartford Whalers, the team relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997. When the 
    team moved, <br>
    the franchise had to change to adapt to and represent their new location. The name was 
    changed to <br>
    'Hurricanes' due to the fact that North Carolina is frequently hit by the storms. The mascot,
    Stormy, is <br>
    an ice hog, which represents North Carolina's pork industry.</p>

<p> In 2006, the Hurricanes defeated the Edmonton Oilers in the <br>
      Stanley Cup final. This was the first and, as of 2024, only <br>
      championship in franchise history. The team was led by <br>
      captain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrEZkK4td0A">Rod Brind'Amour</a>, who is now the current head coach of <br>
      the team.</p>
